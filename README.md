# Clock Puzzle

This project is inspired by the Temporal Rift Clock Puzzle in Final Fantasy XIII-2, and is unfortunately, **not** a faithful recreation of the game.

However, this is an accurate representation of how you can play the puzzle, and there is also a solver included, if you ever get stuck on one of the puzzles in the game. Enjoy!
